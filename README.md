# Phonebook

Implemented using C++ with a BST for DSA class.

_Yes, I'm aware that I should split up the code. The assignment required a single file, so that's why it's all clumped together._

_I could (any probably should) be using smart pointers for everything. I've been more interested in mastering C than I have C++, but the latter was required for this assignment. Hence why I elected to not partake in much of the fluff C++ provides. This is now some weird amalgamation of C and C++, I suppose. I've never really loved C++, it feels like it's trying too hard to impress me._
